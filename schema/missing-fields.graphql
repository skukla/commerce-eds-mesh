# Schema extensions for fields that may not exist on all Commerce backends
#
# These fields are queried by EDS Commerce dropins but require specific modules
# that may not be installed on all Commerce instances. We extend the schema to
# ensure these fields exist, and the resolvers provide default values.

# StoreConfig extensions for customer segment and cart rule sharing
extend type StoreConfig {
  share_active_segments: Boolean
  graphql_share_customer_group: Boolean
  share_applied_cart_rule: Boolean
}

# OrderTotal extension for tax-exclusive grand total
# Note: Money type already exists in Commerce schema
extend type OrderTotal {
  grand_total_excl_tax: Money
}
